  <h2>Week 6</h2>
  <h3>Day 1 - 19/05/2025</h3>
  <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w6d1_bugs.png" alt="w6d1_bugs"></span>
    Today started with debugging, as quite a few more bugs have been found. And that's what I did the whole day, just debugging everything from the included list.
    We also had a little session for deployment, which helped a lot in getting further than we are right now! And then it was back to debugging, but now with my more knowledge it went quite well without major setbacks. Then I also made our presentation for wednesday, because then we have a morning session where we will have ~15 minutes to pitch our project!
    It took some time to figure out how to optimally export gifs, because google slides has a limit of 50mb and most of my high definition gifs were 200mb+. But I found a handy <a href="https://ezgif.com/optimize" target="_blank" > site </a> and I managed to include them in our slides! I also want to use those in the README, but that's for later.
  </p>
  <h3>Day 2 - 20/05/2025</h3>
  <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w6d2_dashboard.png" alt="w6d2_dashboard"></span>
  Today I finished the list of bugs from yesterday, and I also improved our dashboard page! But first I reworked the navbar, as we only really need the change language buttons there. That was fast, as I already had the fragment and just needed to do some tweaks to make it show on every facilitator page. But now the translations even persist when you switch to another page! And I did that via a BaseController (that I used for the navBack method before).
    I think it looks much better now, and then I went on to do the dashboard. I mainly re-used the css I used for the user boxes in the teams page. The only 'trouble' was making it scrollable without having the other elements like the searchbar above and 'add new hackathon' in the footer. But I quite easily but the button in a footer (which immediatly fixed that problem). But for the searchbar I had to do some css as I already used the header for the new translation buttons.
    I also had a meeting with Ann Koolen and Thomas Swolfs, just to see how the internship has been going and if they can recruit me. Then I also did some dry-runs with Dordje to get ready for our presentation tomorrow!
  </p>
  <h3>Day 3 - 21/05/2025</h3>
  <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w6d4_evaluation.png" alt="w6d4_evaluation"></span>
Today started really early, we had a presentation at flexso with other internship students to present what we have. that was at 8h30, until 9h15. Then I started on the Evaluation page, initially this was Dordje's issue (todays picture is that) that he worked on while he was busy with deployment. But I had nothing really to do as the rest is bound to the deployed users and all. Thankfully he only just started an only made the link to the page, and declared the page in our manifest. But first I needed to fix the link that Dordje made, as it didn't show the evaluation page per team (just globally, which isn't what we should have).
    Then I first made a static version just to get into the flow and already design everything. For that I drew a scheme on some paper to better visualize it, that worked well as then it was just a question of setting the correct css classes everywhere. I got quite used to SAPUI5, and used lots of VBox and HBoxes to make sure everything is outlined well. </p>
  Then I just had to do the bindings, thankfully I could copy most from the other code I wrote, as they needed the bindings for /hackathon and /teams. That was easy enough. The only problem was getting the questions and answers.
  It's a nested structure, so I didn't really know how to get there. Because I needed to go from Hackathon->Challenges->Questions&Answers. And the same for Teams->Users. At least I have the binding for a team. But it was already getting late, so I decided to stop on just having Team shown.
  <h3>Day 4 - 22/05/2025</h3>
  <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w6d3_evaluation.png" alt="w6d3_evaluation"></span>
Today I started on working out the issues on getting the nested classes. I somehow couldn't get the hackathonId needed to fetch that whole nested structure of Hackathon->Challenges->Questions&Answers. So I switched on finishing the Teams->Users, and did some edits to format the user bubbles better.
    Then I finally found that I could actually easily fetch the Hackathon->Challenges->Questions&Answers via a complicated $expand when I get the hackathon. And now I had to do some tweaks to the css/visuals. Just to make everything flow together.
    But this structure was getting really big. So I started trying to make the challenges collapsable. First via SAPUI5 functionalities. But that didn't work. So I switched to use the collapse function I use in this blog! I just needed to tweak it a bit so it fit into my controller.ts and that worked!!
    Then I took a smaller issue of 'accept answer as correct if the answer is marked incorrect' and in reverse. For this I used the same PATCH structure I wrote in the attendance controller. So that was done without too much issues. But then, on each change/toggle it changed the order in which the answers were shown. Which is of course bad, because I first show a list of questions and then a list of answers. So how will the enduser know what answer belongs where if the order isn't fixed?
    Apparently this has an easy fix, which is setting in the xml a sorter like this
    <code>items="{
    path: 'challengemodel>answers',
    sorter: {
    path: 'completedTime',
    descending: false
    }
    }"</code>

    Then I just needed to make everything i18n, add some final css changes (because attendance colors were blending into the background) and do some code cleanup like deleting comments. And then the page was finally done!
  </p>
  <h3>Day 5 - 23/05/2025</h3>
  <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w6d5_issues.png" alt="w6d5_issues"></span>
    Today, tragedy struck, my laptop broke. And I could barely work as it just shut down every 15 minutes. So I got busy with other things we needed to do. But first we had our second UX test to do! We did this with Grisja, a Recruitment Officer that's very design oriented and has been in many hackathons organized at Flexso. We got lots of feedback and even went overtime and talked for about an hour. Then I struggled with my laptop, and after noon it was already time for our weekly demo meeting.
    There we discussed with Stijn&Eva, our coaches, what we did, the feedback we got from the UX test and what we will implement. I then made a checklist of everything discussed that we definatly needed to do and put it in an issue. Dordje is still having trouble with deployment. I can't really help him as only he has the BTP account for this, I try just playing a rubber duckie and help ask around for people knowledgable. Because he's already a week in and deployment is still not finished.. So then we had a meeting with Tom, someone knowledgable on CIS to help with deployment, and he gave lots of tips.
    Then I worked on our weekly report until my computer shut down again. And then went home as I can't work like this. In the weekend I was then busy with fixing my laptop. And sunday it was finally done! So then I made our Final leaderboard page (static), to make up for doing little on friday.

  <h2>Week 7</h2>
  <h3>Day 1 - 26/05/2025</h3>
  <p>
      Today I started with Dordje another meeting (like the 5th one on deployment) in the morning with someone else at Flexso to help. Dordje says it was a big help, so that's good. But that deployment is taking so long, and we still have a lot to do.. and I'm doing everything (functionality) alone. I think I'll have to do overtime to make up for Dordje being stuck with deployment. The problem is that some issues are to be done after deployment is set up...
      Then I did a mini standup with Dordje to plan the week, today I finish the final leader board + the new entity 'HackathonTeams' so that different teams can go on `same` hackathon + counting of points (when you correctly answer a question it goes to your rank). Tomorrow I will finish all the feedback and todo's about our code. And wednesday I will make a RabbitMQ service for our notifications. Dordje will finish deployment today and tomorrow start on the questions page, then wednesday do the login screen other deployment related touch ups.
      So then I started on finishing the final leaderboard. So first I made it dynamic, with the teams/RankedTeams binding (I sort them in backend so nobody can cheat). Then I started on the rework to contain HackathonTeams between Teams and Hackathons(previously Themes - still Themes in Frontend). That broke every binding, of course. So I spend the rest of the afternoon on fixing the bindings (adding that HackathonTeams usually). Then it was already getting late (like 18h) so I went home after making sure everything works again and doesn't show any errors.
      Dordje still can't finish deployment. So I also made the css for the login page (it shows 2 floating up bubbles using :before and :after! as I could only use css, and no js/ts..)
  </p>

  <h3>Day 2 - 27/05/2025</h3>
  <p>
      Today I quickly finished the points, that went quite fast thankfully and my issue was merged! I also tested everything out so that it really does show the hackathon per team. And that works, the testing is quite sketchy though because deployment isn't done. I used static id's to simulate the logged in user. Then I also merged the issue Dordje worked on the side (better visuals for his progress page) but I had to do some changes as it broke because of the HackathonTeams and his css syntax had too much newlines.
      Then I started on the big checklist. First I tackled my 1004 lines styles.css file. I really didn't think it would get this big.. So I simply split it up per page (I already wrote titles everywhere, so that was easy). I also discovered some dublicates, so I fixed that. And now, its only 38 lines!! Much better. Then I did the 'create hackathon' button on the dashboard. As it was blue on blue and small, so our UX tester didn't see it. Here I had some trouble overwriting the css of SAPUI5. But in the end, with 'Emphasized' instead of 'NoStyles' it worked + with some css tweaks. This is really strange, but I'll take it.
      Then I got stuck on showing the image in my FormattedText, even with telling it to directly show the HTML, it didn't work. I tried a just a core:HTML but that broke all of the stylings and wasn't pretty. It also somehow appended each challenge instead of replacing it. So then I went to the RichTextEditor, my last resort, And it showed the image! And normally replaced the challenge descriptions with good stylings! I then hid the edit bar above and made the whole RichTextEditor not editable. Then I struggled a bit with making sure it's displaying correctly in the leftPane, and I made it scrollable which wasn't too much trooble.
      Then I removed the GIFs background and changed some colors on the hackathon page. I also added a cute star animation on challenge completion!
      Then I added a new parameter in the question entity, called 'limitNr' to correctly have multiple limit options to set on a question (so how many times you can try to resubmit). Here I had some trouble centering the number next to the input field. As it was either floating or sinking, but with some more HBox and VBoxes it worked out! I then reworked the addPoints() function so that it only triggers onSubmit AND when the answer was false before, so you can't keep getting points. I also made a simple enabled="{= ${viewModel>limitNr} > 0 }" to disable the submit and input fields when its 0.
      I also of course wrote the functionally to do limitNr-1 when you submit! Then I also made sure you can't have multiple active hackathons at once. And that the participants only see the active hackathon. After getting the whole checklist done, I went home. Then, in the evening, I also tried helping Dordje with deployment. And I managed to find that it's searching for views that don't exist and printed them.
  </p>
  <h3>Day 3 - 28/05/2025</h3>
  <p>
    Today I fixed the warning we've lately been getting on deploying the postgres docker (locally). Then I made reservations to do a dry-run for our end presentation in the White Room. That was a bit troublesome, as I don't have the rights to booking Cronos rooms (only Flexso rooms). So after talking to many people I finally secured a spot! Then we had our demo with Stijn, and got some feedback and pointers that I then put together into another checklist. I will work that out first before starting the notification queue.
But I also did some research on that queue, as it has to work on deployment too. But, the RabbitMQ (that is the SAP Event Mesh in BTP), is not aviable in our trail version.. I didn't really find other options. So I guess I'll have to do a manual queue with events via CAP instead. It will be slower, but I'll add it into the documentation so people know why I chose it!
For this research I also got Dordje's BTP account (where the deployment happens). I don't think I'll end up using it, but it's good to have nonetheless if he has trouble with something! 
  </p>
  <h3>Day 4 - 29/05/2025</h3>
  <p>Feast of the Ascension!
Today, to make sure the app is complete next week, I worked on that new checklist. Fixing first the display of "1 try/poging" to "1 try" or "1 poging" in the dropdown select. Then there was the star bug that showed even with false input. That was a quick fix. Then when you delete a team, the team_ID in the users wasn't deleted. So they couldn't be assigned to other teams. For this I wrote a new method that does a PATCH call!
And then I started on the parameter questions. First I reworked the backend (yet again), and added a new entity and seeding for that entity:
<code> entity QuestionParameters : cuid {
  question : Association to one Questions;
  paramType : String;
  paramExamples : array of String;
  paramAnswers : array of String;
}</code> 
</p>
  <h3>Day 5 - 30/05/2025</h3>
  <p>Bridge Day!
  Today I continued on the parameter questions and it became hell, as getting everything and showing everything worked in the end. I first made a static version and then slowly converted that to get the data via bindings. So the frontend looks nice now and only the dynamic data has to be done.
  I made the paramType adding functionality and that wasn't that difficult. I had some trouble making sure it, on selecting another paramType, shows the paramExamples&paramAnswers of that other paramType instead. But in the end it came down to doing a lot of .refresh().
But then, adding or pushing onto the arrays of paramExamples and paramAnswers didn't work. It wasn't a primitive type and so it refused to do that. Then I managed to make it work, but it made each time a new entity instead of updating.
In the end, after lots of headaches and working saturday and sunday, I did another rework of the backend and the seeded data. So it now takes a JSON 'array' that's in a string. So then I needed to refactor the frontend to first do a <code>JSON.parse(parameter.paramExamples) as string[]</code>
and then when 'pushing' onto the list I made this looping try-catch <code>try {
          const examples = JSON.parse(usedParameter.paramExamples) as string[];
          const answers = JSON.parse(usedParameter.paramAnswers) as string[];
          examples.forEach(example => {
            if (example && !paramExamplesList.some(pe => pe.key === example)) {
              paramExamplesList.push({ key: example, text: example });
            }
          });
          answers.forEach(answer => {
            if (answer && !paramAnswersList.some(pa => pa.key === answer)) {
              paramAnswersList.push({ key: answer, text: answer });
            }
          });
        } catch (error) {
          MessageBox.error("Error parsing JSON")
        }
</code>
Afterwards, to clear my mind a bit, I made a new, basic, welcome page; added i18n to some places; cleaned up the functionality of the whole QuestionParameters story; fixed the evaluation page that gave binding errors.
I also made a small button to 'unpublish' an already published hackathon (so it sets the active back to preparation). For that I did some refactoring, and made helper-methods to not have dublicate code. I also added an if so when you complete the hackathon, you go to the final leaderboard (that was easy as it was just the navTo() function). And then the fixes branch was finally done!
