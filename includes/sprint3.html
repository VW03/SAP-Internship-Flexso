    Today started with debugging, as quite a few more bugs have been found. And that's what I did the whole day, just debugging everything from the included list.
    We also had a little session for deployment, which helped a lot in getting further than we are right now! And then it was back to debugging, but now with my more knowledge it went quite well without major setbacks. Then I also made our presentation for wednesday, because then we have a morning session where we will have ~15 minutes to pitch our project!
    It took some time to figure out how to optimally export gifs, because google slides has a limit of 50mb and most of my high definition gifs were 200mb+. But I found a handy <a href="https://ezgif.com/optimize" target="_blank" > site </a> and I managed to include them in our slides! I also want to use those in the README, but that's for later.

  Today I finished the list of bugs from yesterday, and I also improved our dashboard page! But first I reworked the navbar, as we only really need the change language buttons there. That was fast, as I already had the fragment and just needed to do some tweaks to make it show on every facilitator page. But now the translations even persist when you switch to another page! And I did that via a BaseController (that I used for the navBack method before).
    I think it looks much better now, and then I went on to do the dashboard. I mainly re-used the css I used for the user boxes in the teams page. The only 'trouble' was making it scrollable without having the other elements like the searchbar above and 'add new hackathon' in the footer. But I quite easily but the button in a footer (which immediatly fixed that problem). But for the searchbar I had to do some css as I already used the header for the new translation buttons.
    I also had a meeting with Ann Koolen and Thomas Swolfs, just to see how the internship has been going and if they can recruit me. Then I also did some dry-runs with Dordje to get ready for our presentation tomorrow!
