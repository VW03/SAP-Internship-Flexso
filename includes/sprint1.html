    Today I was busy with using SAP Fiori elements (the shellbar) and navigation between pages. I have also made an initial design of the dashboard page where the facilitator will see all the hackathons and a simple edit page for a hackathon to test the routing.
We also had 3 meetings today! One with Ann, just to see if we're doing well in general. Then after a quick lunch we had a meeting with out coach from KdG, and our facilitator from Flexso, Eva. Where we gave an overview on what we plan to do, what we're doing and some quick questions.</p>
