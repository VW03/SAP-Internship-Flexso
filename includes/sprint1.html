    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h3>Day 1 - 21/04/2025</h3>
    <p> It was Easter Monday, so no work!</p>
    <h3>Day 2 - 22/04/2025</h3>

    Today I was busy with using SAP Fiori elements (the shellbar) and navigation between pages. I have also made an initial design of the dashboard page where the facilitator will see all the hackathons and a simple edit page for a hackathon to test the routing.
We also had 3 meetings today! One with Ann, just to see if we're doing well in general. Then after a quick lunch we had a meeting with out coach from KdG, and our facilitator from Flexso, Eva. Where we gave an overview on what we plan to do, what we're doing and some quick questions.
    I had some trouble with making sure the functions in the controller of the fragment were called on each page (menu opens on each page), but it worked out!</p>
    <h3>Day 3 - 23/04/2025</h3>

    Today I started with showing the seeded data from the postgres db in the frontend. It was a simple list of all the hackathons, then made sure I can still go to the hackathon's specific detail page and then added some filtering on the name. It wasn't that difficult but I keep forgetting to add things like 'Filter' to the define above my file. It also doesn't help that it doesn't show errors when I run the program, and I only understood what's wrong when I saw the console logs.
I also made sure that the filtering happens in the backend and not the frontend. Then I went on to a create button, I used a fragment for the pop-up dialog. And it went pretty smoothly as I've made a fragment for the navbar yesterday. I really like how it's not an ugly bare-bones thing and already styled too! It also updates the postgres db and you can immediatly filter on the newly added hackathon, which I also like.
