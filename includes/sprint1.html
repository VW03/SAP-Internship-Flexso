    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h3>Day 1 - 21/04/2025</h3>
    <p> It was Easter Monday, so no work!</p>
    <h3>Day 2 - 22/04/2025</h3>
    <p> <span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w2d1_nav.png" alt="w2d1_nav"></span>
    Today I was busy with using SAP Fiori elements (the shellbar) and navigation between pages. I have also made an initial design of the dashboard page where the facilitator will see all the hackathons and a simple edit page for a hackathon to test the routing.
We also had 3 meetings today! One with Ann, just to see if we're doing well in general. Then after a quick lunch we had a meeting with out coach from KdG, and our facilitator from Flexso, Eva. Where we gave an overview on what we plan to do, what we're doing and some quick questions.
    I had some trouble with making sure the functions in the controller of the fragment were called on each page (menu opens on each page), but it worked out!</p>
    <h3>Day 3 - 23/04/2025</h3>
    <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w2d2_backend.png" alt="w2d2_backend"></span>
    Today I started with showing the seeded data from the postgres db in the frontend. It was a simple list of all the hackathons, then made sure I can still go to the hackathon's specific detail page and then added some filtering on the name. It wasn't that difficult but I keep forgetting to add things like 'Filter' to the define above my file. It also doesn't help that it doesn't show errors when I run the program, and I only understood what's wrong when I saw the console logs.
I also made sure that the filtering happens in the backend and not the frontend. I then started brainstorming and thinking on how we will make many unique questions for the hackathon. I think I have an outlined idea, but I'll pitch it friday to our client/coach, Stijn.
        Then I went on to a create button, I used a fragment for the pop-up dialog. And it went pretty smoothly as I've made a fragment for the navbar yesterday. I really like how it's not an ugly bare-bones thing and already styled too! It also updates the postgres db and you can immediatly filter on the newly added hackathon, which I also like.

    <h3>Day 4 - 24/04/2025</h3>
    <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w2d3_teams.png" alt="w2d3_teams"></span>
    Today was a long day, I arrived earlier and stayed longer, all the while only working on 1 (big) isssue. Namely, the teams page for a hackathon (show teams + users in the teams, create a new team and add a user to a team). And I got stuck getting the teams table via the users, and getting the users via the teams also wasn't working. What also didn't help is that I tried many different view types (list, table, grid, tree) to show this data. And the tree view that I liked, used some kind of magic that I still don't fully get to show the teams class from the users. I could only manage to show the team titles (IDs because the link also didn't work) when I also showed them in the inner user boxes.
I don't really feel at home yet in this language, the things I want to do require some research to see if I even can do that. Thankfully in the afternoon I found how I could get the teams too, not via the tutorial way (because the links to where its located didn't match), but it's something I've kinda done in Java. So that was problem 1 done, visually I'm not really happy, but it gets the job done. I then added a create team button and decided to leave the final add user to team functionality to tomorrow. That went well, making dialog windows and create functionality is now easy in SAP. And I like how I'm showing the hackathon name above, I think it's user-friendly!

    <h3>Day 5 - 25/04/2025</h3>
    <p> <span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w2d4_adduser.png" alt="w2d4_adduser"></span>
Today I am starting to get SAP and CAP. I made a dialog fragment for the add user, struggled a bit to get the 'AvailableParticipants' from a list made in the backend. Because there will be many participants, so I needed to filter them already in the backend. So they're not in a team yet and are not a facilitator. And the problems came from the team_ID, that isn't defined in the entity (only the relationship to Teams). But in the end it was pretty simple and the filtering works!
Then I was busy with saving the user correctly, which worked in the end. I also cleaned up some code and made some helper files, because my teams controller was getting big with 2 whole fragments with each 3 methods (create,save,cancel). Then I prepared my materials to pitch my unique questions ideas (big zip assignment, API endpoints like weather/planets, a base question with different params like these inputs/outputs and these algoritms that can mix and match - the only problem here is that I don't know yet how to validate this, because there will be thousands of different questions). And all 3 were accepted, we will just have to see how the validation will go, and monday talk with others from Flexso to hear their input!
After this meeting I went to make a few fixes and started delete functionality.

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <h3>Day 1 - 28/04/2025</h3>
    <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w3d1_teams.png" alt="w3d1_teams"></span>
        Today I went on to finish the delete of a team and delete of a user in the morning. Each delete window has an "are you sure?" and it shows a success window when it's deleted. And I did the create a new user, with new backend paramaters (phone,organisation) and I used a fragment to show this. I added the phone and organisation to the overview too! And I also used regex to check the phone number and for the other fields it's just on required. Then we had a meeting with both our Flexso coaches and someone (Grisja) that's very close to the hackathons of Flexso/Cronos group. We demo'd our app and ideas, and got some feedback. Mainly that the Participants should have a themed visual, so it's fun and all. We will leave that to sprint 2.
        Then I did the backend refractor to contain statuses of a hackthon and then show them in the main dashboard overview. Then I started on the constraints for the hackathons (teams: only when status is - preparation/active, Q&A: only when status is active). Then I started on making/thinking about how we will do our first user experience tests.

        I am glad I am making a lot of progress, having already done the
    <ul>
        <li><a>hackathons: search,show,create</a></li>
        <li><a>teams: show,create,delete</a></li>
        <li><a>users: show per team, add to team,create a new one, delete one</a></li>
    </ul>
        a shame my partner is still on the same issue from begin last week, we would've been so much farther :(.

    <h3>Day 2 - 29/04/2025</h3>
    <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w3d2_teams.png" alt="w3d2_teams"></span>
    Today I at first didn't know what to do, because I finished our whole backlog of 5 issues yesterday. So I stole an issue that was originally for Dordje. It was logging attendance for users, with only showing and the text and enabling the btn for active hackathons. The attendance status I added at the end, because before I only made the button, but the user didn't see the change which is bad. I also added colors and custom text (instead of not user-friendly the enum text). I had a little roadblock here in that I was using the /hackathon endpoint instead of /team for my model, but after some coffee it worked out well! I also of course added a new enum in backend to have the 3 possible attendance values (Abscent; AbscentNoNotice; Present). I also in the backend mark everyone as present initionally, so the facilitator should only mark abscent people (but I still give the chance to change it back to 'present' in case of human-errors).
Then I went to review Dordje's first real issue, and I had a lot of comments sadly. btn's didn't work and all.. Then I started working a bit on the code cleanup, I feel like I'll have to rewrite Dordje's code too. After, I went to do our documentationn/README as we didn't really have anything yet. I also made a 'fun' version so I'm curious what our coaches will say or allow this. Just in case I backed up the boring version!
            </p>
    <h3>Day 3 - 30/04/2025</h3>
        <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w3d3_water.png" alt="w3d3_water"></span>
Today I was busy with mainly refactoring the code and making everything use i18n. Then translating it to dutch. And of course making a btn in the navbar to change the language. I can't make the function yet because Dordje started on the js -> ts rework, so I'll have to wait for that. I also tested yesterday how to put a background image in our app, and today I poked around in how to do it on multiple pages, I have yet to find something for an animation/gif/slideshow. But our app already looks more fun!</p>
    <h3>Day 4 - 01/05/2025</h3>
    <p>No work today, it's International Workers' Day!</p>
    <h3>Day 5 - 02/05/2025</h3>
    <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w3d5_teams.png" alt="w3d5_teams"></span>
    Today I started early to finish splitting up the big 400+ lines controller. That worked out well, the only thing I really needed to change in the functions is add instead of just 'this' 'this._controller' so it still uses the teams controller. I have a feeling it can be even shorter, but we'll have to wait for our code review! Then we found out there was a mistake during conversion from js to ts for the attendance button. I need to keep this in mind to test everything before sending out our code for the review.
Then I went on to replace alle the MessageToasts with MessageBoxes,  because the boxes have a .success and all and thats mutch prettier. Then I fixed the error when you first clicked on a create team, and then the create user that the team dialog was shown (it was an easy fix because I was trying to be too efficient and reuse the Dialog create, which was the wrong move here). Then after going over the btns it all seems to work. And I went to finally restyle the teams page so it's not so ugly.
