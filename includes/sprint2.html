  Today I started on the hackathon page for the participants, the layout wasn't that challenging. But getting the challenges was. Because Dordje is doing the 'get the logged in user' link for our two pages that come from the same button. I'll have to wait with merging this one. It's not done yet anyway, but maybe my error comes from there, that I don't have the linkings to any page (it is defined in the manifest though). Then we had two meetings, one with out coach Eva where we told her what our plan is for sprint 2! It starts this week and ends the 16th of May.
    Then we also had a meeting in the afternoon with Stijn where we gave a little demo of what we have. And we got some feedback on that. Then I went on to further work on my hackathon page. I also had to do a backend rework to show the desired structure of one big question with smaller sub-questions that you can answer.
