  Today I started on the hackathon page for the participants, the layout wasn't that challenging. But getting the challenges was. Because Dordje is doing the 'get the logged in user' link for our two pages that come from the same button. I'll have to wait with merging this one. It's not done yet anyway, but maybe my error comes from there, that I don't have the linkings to any page (it is defined in the manifest though). Then we had two meetings, one with out coach Eva where we told her what our plan is for sprint 2! It starts this week and ends the 16th of May.
    Then we also had a meeting in the afternoon with Stijn where we gave a little demo of what we have. And we got some feedback on that. Then I went on to further work on my hackathon page. I also had to do a backend rework to show the desired structure of one big question with smaller sub-questions that you can answer.

Today I started on getting the get working. Before it didn't work because I used dataRequested instead of oBinding?.getContexts(). I think it's a difference between the o2 and o4 documentation. Then I made the page a bit prettier (rounded corners, spacing between questions, ..). Then I went on to do the validation. For now it's the easy variant that just checks if the input answer is the same as the saved correct answer. And of course I also added pretty green/red glowing border on submit.
Then I also made the buttons to go to the previous/next challenge a bit prettier/bigger. Then we had our feedback on the UX. It was more conseptual feedback than UI feedback. Because the one we had a meeting with, Nicolas, had already done 11 hackathons! So his input was really valuable. We also discussed how we could do our deployment our user management in there. I am glad it seems easier than we thought as Dordje was able to set up an BTP account for the deployment without trouble under Nicolas' guidance!
Almost right after we had our 3rd meeting with our coach from KdG, there we had an online meeting with Eva. It was quite the short meeting as we just said that we are doinig well and what we already have, Eva send in our midway evaluation and that was all. Maybe it's good that it was short because we have nothing bad going on!
      Then I reworked the backend yet agian to include timestamps and discussed with Dordje how we will show the time per question per team. Then I realised I was giving the wrong challenge ID when I was saving an answer, so I fixed that. And at the end of the day I also saw that I wasn't saving the teamAnswer ID in the question table on the save of an answer. Which is obvious as I only did a call to the Answers table. But I left that for tomorrow.

  <h3>Day 3 - 07/05/2025</h3>
      <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w4d3_hackathon.png" alt="w4d3_hackathon"></span>
Today I started on doing that call to the Questions table to change the teamAnswer ID to the ID of the created answer. That wasn't that easy, as I had to wait until that answer was saved, and then get that answer (because the IDs are created automatically on create). But after this my page was finally kinda done! After some cleanup I went to merge issues of Dordje. And then he merged mine and I only had a few merge conflicts that shouldn't even have been conflicts because it was literally just some css that can be put under each other and the manifest file that had 2 routes. I'm really glad we have so little conflicts, maybe it's because we're a small team and devide our issues really well?
Then I tested many different ways to show the navigation to challenges (we need an overview so just the two previous/next buttons aren't enough). But in the end I settled on SideNavigation and stars that are either filled or not based on wether the challenge is completed or not. I also made it collapsable so it's not in the way when its not needed.

  Today I started really early (before 8am) and I made a very pretty leaderboard! I even made a video of it instead of a screenshot!! I'm super proud of this :D I also made it refresh every 5 minutes (for the demo I set it to every 5 seconds). I also made sure the participants can navigate to this dynamic leaderboard from their hackathon flow screens. Sadly I couldn't really find a fitting ranking icon, so I used a trophy instead. Then I went on to make a working progressbar for the teams based on the number of completed challenges. I also made it sea themed and animated (it has literal waves inside!) and a pretty gradient too! 
Then I went on to show the weight/number of points a question has. And made sure that now, when you fill in all the questions that challenge is marked completed. And when you complete all the challenges you get confetti! (like on canvas when you finish a task)
Thankfully the bindings were mostly set up, so I didn't have to struggle with that much today.

  <h3>Day 5 - 09/05/2025</h3>
  <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w4d5_confetti.png" alt="w4d5_confetti"></span>
Today I worked on making a working script to check questions. I was busy with that for the whole day (besides the 2 meetings)! It was not so easy to work out how I put javascript into the db and then make a working function from that string to then run it. And compare the input it gives with the output the user gave for that question.
    We then had 2 meetings in the afternoon, the first one was with Stijn (not coach) and he had reviewed our code up to this point. His advice was really helpful and thankfully he found our code quite nicely done!
Afterwards we had a demo with our 2 coaches, Stijn and Eva. We showed our app and discussed on how we will proceed regarding the questions (now we have 4 types - including the one I just showed a demo of today). We will have to do some changes, but I'm sure it'll work out well!

  <h2>Week 5</h2>
  <h3>Day 1 - 12/05/2025</h3>
  <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w5d1_structure.png" alt="w5d1_structure"></span>
    Today I started working on our feedback from the other Stijn (the one we got our code review from). And first I started with documenting our backend (e.g.  progressBar : Integer - what kind of values can be in there?
</br> I made from that ```progressbar : Integer; // Shows the number of challenges completed in % (0%-100%).``` then I went on to reformat our services so they use the correct NULL. Then my first roadblock started, I had to finish what Dordje started, the js to ts transformation. In here he couldn't do the service.js and server.js, one is the connection frontend-backend, the other has a method to get the user info (is the logged in user a facilitator for example).
And in ts it just didnt want to work! I tried so many things, but in the end I just deleted everything and wrote it anew.. and that worked! Then I corrected a few px'ses that Dordje left in. Besides in his question files, as he's working in them right now and we don't want big merge conflicts. So that's something I'll do later.
Then I started on writing typescript as intended, using interfaces. I rewrote everything to use those (instead of any or locally made ones). After I went to remove some dublicate code in the DialogHandler and I fixed a small bug where in a dialog pop-up it immediatly focuses on the search bar, showing the suggestions and obstructing the view.
Which is not user friendly of course. And I had to look a bit for this because per documentation you should use 'autofocus=false' but that worked for one second and then it showed the suggestions again. So I got creative and declared in the parent tag (the Dialog tag) that initialFocus="cancelButton"
and now it focuses there (which isn't really visible anyway) and the search bar still works completly! </p>
  <h3>Day 2 - 13/05/2025</h3>
  <p><span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/w5d2_pink.png" alt="w5d2_pink"></span>
Today I continued working on refactoring the whole day! I got stuck on making sure the challenges and questions update correctly when I complete a challenge/question. Because after I made it all work, my controller was way too long, so I split it up. And that destroyed the working links. So I had to re-do many things. But in the end it got better as I made many little helper functions that check if challenge is complete or if a question is complete. And then, to reduce reduntancy, I made a function that calls those two checks!
Then I made sure you can log in as different users (Participant/Facilitator) and are send to the corresponding page. That was quite easy, as I only needed to tweak Dordje's function a bit to make it work fully!
After I went to the more fun part, css! Specifically making modular themes. Because before I wrote static colours everywhere (which would be a pain to change them all when the theme is no longer 'underwater'). So I made a css data-theme, where I painstakingly put all the used colours and sorted them based on where they are used. So it's easier to maintain.
Then to test this, I made a valentine-coded theme, with pretty pinks and all. But it only half-worked. And that's really strange because I just forgot to put the theme in the index.html. So it strange the theme was applied at all. I also made 2 files that each contain specific theming css.
For ease of use. In there I also managed to modularize the gifs background! Which I'm happy with. After all that I added documentation to the README.md with clear steps on how to change the theme if you wanted.
