                <h2>About this blog</h2>
                <p>I am doing my internship at Flexso, it is a Hackathon project that I will be writing in SAPUI5 and CAPIRE!</p>
                <p>During my internship, I’ll be keeping a daily log (blog) to document my experiences. Each day, I’ll write about a quarter of a page, summarizing what I worked on, any challenges I encountered, and how I resolved them.</p>
                <p>There will be 8 weeks, and 5 entries per week.</p>

                <h2>Week 1</h2>
                <h3>Day 1 - 31/03/2025</h3>
                <p>
<!--                    <img class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/vw.png" alt="selfie">-->
                Today we had an introduction about Flexso itself. It was very broad because we got it together with 2 people that start working at Flexso. Then, in the afternoon we got our gitlab accounts and I started to setup the frontend. I had difficulties making it from scratch so I followed a Hello World tutorial.</p>
                <h3>Day 2 - 01/04/2025</h3>
                <p> <span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/d2_backend.png" alt="backend v0.1"></span>
                    This morning I wanted to have the backend setup, because at 1pm we had a meeting with one of our facilitator. That went quite easy because the CAP has very good documentation. The only problem was downloading the library to use CAP, I got errors on the repository, but with some AI it was resolved. At the meeting at 1pm I got some feedback in how they use SAP themes instead of custom css and a tip to use the special CAP cuid (a variant on UUID).
Afterwards I watched some tutorials on CAP and SAP, made some issues and started working on the wireframes. Since we got some more info at our 1pm meeting on the scope.</p>
                <h3>Day 3 - 02/04/2025</h3>
                <p> <span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/d3_theme.png" alt="theme"></span>
                    Today I have finished the 3 sprints backlog, linking issues too. There was a little problem in that our gitlab accounts are not Premium, so we don't have weights or burndowncharts. But to still somehow have weights, because I think it's important, I added labels with a weight from 1 to 5. Then I finished the wireframes and got to work on the theme our facilitator mentioned yesterday. I used the fiori theme for our project, it was very easy to setup!
Then I made the domain model and added a merge request template. Then, together with Dordje we did the sprint planning (assignment of weightsa and in what sprint we'll do what).</p>
                <h3>Day 4 - 03/04/2025</h3>
                <p>  <span class="image-container"><img onclick="showPopup(this)" class="user-picture picture-article" src="/SAP-Internship-Flexso/images/d4_backend.png" alt="backend v1"></span>
                    Today was a CAP day, I filled in our backend domain and added services for those entities. Then I went to do the connection between backend and frontend. Which went without that much trouble, but it used a generated page instead of my custom one. And I got a lot of errors because the backend had no data. This is where my problems began as I tried to add routing because for some reason I couldn't find where I change the current generated page to the custom one. But that didn't work either as it constantly gave errors on that we have no data in our entities. I also had to change from using .ts files to .js files, because the .ts files weren't correctly compiling to the .js files... I followed a few routing tutorials and tried out a few things before frying my brain and deciding to sleep it over for now.</p>
                <h3>Day 5 - 04/04/2025</h3>
                <p>I reverted in the morning to the working commit (with some trouble as VSCode doesn't have that good of an interface as JetBrains to do that). Then I went on to create the postgres database, so I could seed at least some data.</p>
