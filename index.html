                <h2>About this blog</h2>
                <p>K10s is not just another Kubernetes management platform; it‚Äôs the outcome of a university project initiated at Karel de Grote University of Applied Sciences in Antwerp, Belgium. Originally conceived as a tool to visually represent Kubernetes clusters, K10s quickly evolved into a powerful open-source solution that goes beyond basic cluster management.</p>
                <p>This platform offers a hierarchical view of Kubernetes ecosystems, including superclusters, pools, nodes, and pods. With K10s, users can better understand the performance, interconnections, and management of their Kubernetes resources, all in one place. Beyond its functionality, K10s reflects the innovation and collaborative spirit of Karel de Grote University, where it all began.</p>
                <p>On this site, you'll not only find detailed information about the software, but also the journey behind K10s, including presentations made to pitch the idea to professors, promo videos, quotes, photos, examples, and much more.</p>
